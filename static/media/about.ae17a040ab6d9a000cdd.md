# Intro

I completed my B.Tech from [PDPM IIITDM Jabalpur](https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/)  in Mechanical Engineering and joined [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) as a direct Ph.D. student in August 2021. In my doctoral work, my goal is to study the turbulence and physics behind various geophysical and geodynamic processes such as cloud formation, earth mantle convection, etc. I perform high-fidelity DNS and LES simulations, in a conventional rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection setup, using our cluster "IRON" and the HPC facilities at IITK. Besides these I like reading about the use of A.I. in fluid mechanics, MHD flows in tokamak and astrophysical bodies, etc.

# Currently

I am working on the simulation of zonal flow in a rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection setup. Such flows are encountered in the equatorial region of planets, especially gas giants such as Jupiter.  The flows look simple yet the physics involved is far more complicated, and hence needs understanding.
